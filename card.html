				The king cobra's skin is olive green with black and white bands on the trunk that converge to the head. The king cobra is sexually dimorphic, with males being larger and paler in particular during the breeding season. The head of a mature snake can be quite massive and bulky in appearance. Like most extant snakes, due to macrostomy, it can expand its jaws to swallow large prey items.
